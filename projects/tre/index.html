In contrast to every other connected device in the world, Tre is not solving any problems or making life more efficient. It is simply designed as a charming interior ornament to be placed alongside other trinkets and things on a shelf or window still. Quietly, in the background, it will let you know that something has occurred.</p></div></div><!-- /row --><div class="row row-images"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 last"><img src=/img/blank.1ff3.png class="dynamic-image img-16by9" data-src=Tre/tre_down data-crop=fill data-quality=90 data-dpr=auto></div></div><!-- /row --><div class="row row-content"><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3"><p class=last>For an example you can connect it up to a service such as Swarm/Foursquare in order to alert you about your friends’ checks-ins. When nothing is happening, Tre will just look like a normal tree. But, if someone you know checks in to a venue nearby, it will notify you by revealing its friendly face.</p></div></div><!-- row --><div class="row row-images"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 last"><img src=/img/blank.1ff3.png class="dynamic-image img-16by9" data-src=Tre/tre data-crop=fill data-quality=90 data-dpr=auto></div></div><!-- /row --><div class="row row-content"><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3"><p>Together with Ugle, Tre continues our exploration of the <a href=https://twitter.com/topfife/status/278459980976361472>“Internet of Ornaments”</a>. Tre as product is interesting in it self. However, Tre also takes part in our research into making visible the technological substrate of contemporary products.</p><p>As part of our research, Tre was primarily designed so as to be unpacked, to explore the world that lies behind its mere physical appearance and behaviour. We asked how might we trace, map and make visible the web of articulations and actors that compose a seemingly simple and naive product, and how may we visualise and draw attention to the unattended and invisible actors that afford the emergence of hybrid products?</p></div></div><!-- row --><div class="row row-images"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 last"><img src=/img/blank.1ff3.png class="dynamic-image img-responsive" data-src=Tre/tre_kode_kart_web data-crop=fill data-quality=90 data-dpr=auto></div></div><div class="row row-content"><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3"><p>The illustration above (drawn by <a href="http://cargocollective.com/ingridrognstad/">Ingrid Rognstad</a>) is a depiction of a tracing of the electric signal that makes Tre’s head pop up, all the way from the stepper motor to the originating touch of a mobile screen.
