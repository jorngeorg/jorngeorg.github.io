It’s been a while since our last dispatch. As you might know, Einar and I have been busy wrapping up our PhDs for the last couple of years or so (yes, academia is slow). In June I successfully completed the oral defence of my thesis. So you can call me Dr. Knutsen now. Einar will do the same on October 6th at AHO. Come along!</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2"><h4><a href=/2013/02/opinions>Opinions!</a></h4><p>We recently won a opinion-article competition! The competition was organised by <a href="http://norskform.no/Temaer/Nyheter/Nytt-fra-Norsk-Form/Kronikkonkurranse/">Norsk Form</a> and <a href="http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/11/27/kultur/debatt/kronikk/teknologi/design/24563068/">Dagbladet</a>, and centred around design and society. We wrote a text about technology, politics and the wonders of the Norwegian public services. We argue for using design as a lens for examining the opportunities and problematics brought forward by the rapid digitalisation of society.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2"><h4><a href=/2012/10/means-of-production>Means of production</a></h4>Last week I talked at <a href=http://www.thisisplayful.com>Playful</a> at <a href="https://plus.google.com/103262167641188609754/about?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB">Conway Hall</a> in London. Playful is a conference about design, games and technology organized by <a href=http://mountanalogue.wordpress.com>Greg Povey</a> and <a href=http://www.wearemudlark.com>Mudlark</a>. This year it covered a wide range of topics; from market research, to digital craft, to clapping. It was an interesting and well-curated event that offered both insights, critique and entertaining examples from different disciplines. Mudlark had put together a purposefully varied group of <a href=http://www.thisisplayful.com/#speakers>speakers</a> from design, art, research etc.</div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2"><h4><a href=/2012/07/geospire>Geospire</a></h4>Last year we designed and built an interactive exhibition called Geospire for the <a href="http://www.nhm.uio.no/english/visiting/geological-museum/">Oslo Geological Museum</a>. Geospire was developed in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.nhm.uio.no/english/">Oslo Natural History Museum</a> and <a href="http://www.uv.uio.no/intermedia/english/">Intermedia</a> at the University of Oslo. The exhibition is aimed at schoolchildren and is about typical rocks and landscapes in Oslo.</div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2"><h4><a href=/2012/05/vimeo-awards-2012>Vimeo Awards 2012!</a></h4><p>Today Vimeo have announced that our film <a href="http://yourban.no/2011/02/22/immaterials-light-painting-wifi/">‘Immaterials: WiFi light painiting’</a> has made it into the finals for the <a href=https://vimeo.com/awards/finalists/captured>Vimeo Awards 2012</a>.

The film have been nominated in the <em>Captured</em> category alongside three other fine films. The winner will be announced at an award cermony in New York on June 7 as a part of the <a href=https://vimeo.com/awards/festival>Vimeo Festival</a>. We are excited!</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2"><h4><a href=/2012/05/hoot-hoot-a-new-ugle-film>Hoot hoot! - a new Ugle film</a></h4>Ugle is a wooden owl that can be controlled over the internet with an iPhone application. It let's you send colour-messages from your phone to your home. When you change the position of the colors on the owl on the screen, the physical owl turns it's head to the chosen color. It is a decorative personal message system where the household has to decide what the colours mean. We have just made a film that shows the owl in use.</div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2"><h4><a href=/2012/03/networked-messines-of-london>London and network friction</a></h4>I've just spent a week in London. Sitting at borrowed desks in <a href="http://www.riglondon.com/">nice</a> <a href="http://berglondon.com/">studios</a> (thanks!), lecturing at Goldsmiths' <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/design/">Department of Design</a>, and actually seeing the London sun for the first time in 10 years. Brilliant, but my phone doesn't like it. Busses are so big that they disturb its compass' sense of magnetic orientation. 'Move away from any interference' the phone says while I'm stuck inside several tons of double-decker-shaped metal that might very well be heading in the wrong direction.</div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2"><h4><a href=/2012/02/norcon-and-imaginary-cities>Norcon and imaginary cities</a></h4><p>This weekend I'll be participating in <a href="http://norcon.fandom.no/">Norcon</a> at Chateau Neuf in Oslo (10-12 Feb). Norcon is a fantasy and sci-fi convention, and this year the program includes the mandatory zombies, dragons, steampunk and space-travel, as well as urban zoology, biomechanics, particle physics, dear old  Lovecraft and a bit of mythical Norse human sacrifice. <em>Cities</em> is one of the thematic threads  that runs through this year's Norcon. And on Sunday I'll be joining Ragnar Tørnquist from <a href="http://www.funcom.com/">Funcom</a> and the brilliant city-breeder and novelist <a href=http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/unsolving-city-interview-with-china.html>China Miéville</a> on a panel about imaginary cities. I'm really looking forward to this!

I really like how the modern day Sherlock makes clever use of mundane networked city life. At its best the series weaves bits of everyday technologies into scenes as hints to what Sherlock is up to. For example iPhone message-sounds going of and the blue glow on Sherlock's pale face when he dramatically writes and reads his SMSs (that Watson crucially often don't get to see, but that we do).</div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2"><h4><a href=/2012/01/the-wind-speaker-2>The Wind Speaker</a></h4>We have made a (kind of) music video for the musician <a href="http://sommer.alog.net/">Espen Sommer Eide / Phonophani</a>. In this film Espen plays his new instrument the 'Wind Speaker'. We helped Espen construct this peculiar instrument, and contributed with designing and woodworking.</div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2"><h4><a href=/2012/01/playlist>The Playlist Club / Svartsyn</a></h4>Einar has made a <a href=http://playlistclub.co.uk/svartsyn-by-einar-sneve-martinussen>playlist</a> for our friends at <a title="Playlist Club" href="http://playlistclub.co.uk/">Playlist Club</a>. It's called Svartsyn (black-sight) and is a collection that explores an peculiar undercurrent of darkness running through Norwegian musical history from gloomy folk music from the dark middle ages, to contemporary black metal.
